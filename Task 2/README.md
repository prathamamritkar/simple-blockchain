## 2. Short Report

<!-- 2. Write a Short Report (150â€“200 words):
- Compare and contrast the technical capabilities of each.
- Which platform would you choose for:
- A decentralized app?
- A supply chain network among known partners?
- An inter-bank financial application?
- Justify your choice based on technical points. -->
Solana, R3 Corda, and IBM Food Trust differ in design and technical capabilities. Solana, a public blockchain, combines Proof of History (PoH) with Proof of Stake (PoS) to achieve unparalleled throughput (~65,000 TPS) and sub-second latency, ideal for decentralized applications (dApps) requiring speed and scalability. Its open, permissionless model supports Rust/C/C++ smart contracts and native SOL tokens, making it a powerhouse for DeFi, NFTs, and open ecosystems. R3 Corda in Private Mode operates as a permissioned ledger optimized for enterprises, prioritizing privacy and direct P2P transactions. Its pluggable consensus (Raft for crash tolerance, PBFT for Byzantine fault tolerance) and Kotlin/Java-based CorDapps suit regulated financial workflows but lack native tokens. IBM Food Trust, a consortium blockchain built on Hyperledger Fabric, uses PBFT consensus and modular chaincode (Go/Java/Node.js) to ensure data integrity and privacy for supply chains, enabling traceability among trusted partners.
- **Decentralized app (dApp):** Solana as its public, high-TPS architecture and low fees support large-scale dApps, while PoH ensures deterministic transaction ordering without bottlenecks.
- **Supply chain network among known partners:** IBM Food Trust as its permissioned, modular design allows controlled data sharing and auditability among known entities, critical for traceability and compliance.
- **Inter-bank financial application:** R3 Corda as its private P2P transactions, pluggable BFT consensus, and lack of public tokenization align with banking privacy needs and regulatory requirements.
